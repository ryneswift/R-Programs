R code and outputs showing machine learning, simulation, data visualization, cleaning, and analysis.

The 'Code Files' folder contains .rmd files, while the "Output Files" folder contains .pdf outputs corresponding to each .rmd.

Note that the TMDB Movies file is a work in progress, and I intend to complete my analysis of its data by early November.
